## Who Are You?
Glad you asked. I'm someone who believes that passion, integrity, and a willingness to serve can change the world. I'm a librarian by training and a poet by upbringing. 



## Why I'm Running For NMRT President-Elect
I believe that the health of any organization is best demonstrated by how it provides opportunities for its newest members. I believe that the greatest resources we have as library professionals are our colleagues.
